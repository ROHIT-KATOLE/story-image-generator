He knows that sharing such 'fantastical' elements would only lead to his superiors dismissing the entire incident as a drug-induced hallucination or a desperate final act of a madman, effectively sidelining him from what he senses is a monumental threat. His loyal constable, Katekar, notices Sartaj's unusual reticence but trusts his inspector's judgment, offering a silent, knowing glance.\n\nWith the official investigation focusing on the obvious—Gaitonde's associates, his business dealings, and the immediate aftermath of the shootout—Sartaj begins his own clandestine inquiry.

Anjali, initially wary and professionally guarded, listens with growing intensity. Her sharp mind quickly grasps the implications, the potential national security threat lurking beneath the surface of a simple murder investigation.

Anjali begins to feed Sartaj intelligence gleaned from her secure networks, revealing that Gaitonde had indeed made several clandestine trips abroad in recent years, interacting with individuals linked to extremist groups and shadowy international arms dealers.

Sartaj leans on his contacts in the local crime branch, discreetly inquiring about any unusual movements of materials or personnel. Anjali uses her RAW connections to tap into global databases, searching for similar patterns or known methods of attack. The clues lead them down a terrifying path: a combination of rare isotopes and specialized detonators, suggesting a **dirty bomb** or a similar radiological device. The scale of such an event, especially in a densely populated city like Mumbai, is almost unimaginable.\n\nTheir investigation narrows down potential targets based on infrastructure vulnerabilities and symbolic importance. The city's iconic landmarks, major transport hubs, and even densely packed residential areas all become grim possibilities. The pressure mounts as the 25-day deadline looms closer, now just days away. Sleepless nights are filled with frantic phone calls, heated debates, and the constant fear of failure. Katekar, sensing the gravity of the situation, becomes an invaluable, if unwitting, assistant, helping Sartaj navigate the bureaucracy and gather local intelligence.

They meticulously study blueprints of the ashram, cross-referencing them with satellite imagery provided by Anjali's agency. The night of the infiltration is tense. Sartaj remains at a remote command post with Anjali, monitoring the live feeds, his heart pounding with every static-filled whisper from the operatives' comms. The ashram is far more fortified and active than anticipated, with silent, watchful guards patrolling the perimeter and surprising pockets of activity even late at night.
